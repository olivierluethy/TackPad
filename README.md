## About The Project

I have always had the ambition to create a note-taking application, but for a long time I struggled to figure out how to approach building one. Taking a coding course transformed my skills and inspired me to finally start this project.

Once I had mapped out the use cases and features I needed for the application, I began the development phase. Surprisingly, the process was smoother and less challenging than I expected.

After completing the first version and publishing it to GitHub, I started thinking about how to improve the application. This led to the decision to implement a login system to ensure that users can securely access their own notes without seeing other people's data.

I am excited about the future of this project and look forward to seeing how it evolves. One thing is for sure - I have accomplished everything I set out to do when I first started the project!

Future Mission: This application should have end-to-end encryption so that no bulk text gets into the database, only the hash.

## Installation Guide

1. **Install Git:**
   - Download and install Git on your local machine from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

2. **Clone the Project:**
   - Choose a suitable location on your computer.
   - Right-click on the folder and select "Git Bash Here".
   - In the command prompt window, type:
     ```sh
     git clone https://github.com/olivierluethy/TackPad.git
     ```

3. **Setup Local Database:**
   - You will need a local database to run the application. I recommend using [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).
   - Ensure you download and install the latest version for compatibility.

4. **Run the Application:**
   - Follow the setup instructions provided with the project to configure and run it locally.
