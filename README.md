<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I always wanted to build a notes app, but I had for long time difficulties about how to create something like it. Once I went to a course and it maybe changed my entier coding experience, but I don't know.

After the course I started building the notes app. But firstly I thought what the application should know or what kind of skills it should have.
When I finalised any kind of use case I finally started coding. It went pretty fast and it wasn't so difficult as expected.

Althouth when I finished coding the project and put everything on github I thought more and more, how I could make the application better. So I decided to add a login system, so that everyone can create an account and also only sees his notes and not something from the other people.

Let's see what the project will make in futureüòÅ
But one thing I can say is, that I could do everything I planned before starting to code!

<!-- INSTALLATION -->
## Installation Guide

1. At first you need to install git on your local computer. For that you need to go to this [website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
2. Go to your windows explorer and search for a good place for storing this project
3. Now right click on your folder or place and then click on "Git Bash Here"
4. Finally you will see something opened up like the windows command prompt. If you do you only have to enter this
   ```sh
   git clone http://192.168.100.57:3000/Olivier_Luethy/TackPad.git
   ```
5. When you success cloned the project, you need to have a lokal database. I used [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/de/index.html). If you want to use it too, then please make sure you download the latest version of it. Otherwise it doesn't mite work as expected.
